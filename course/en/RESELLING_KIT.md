# 💼 How to resell the kit

In this lesson you'll learn how to turn the kit itself into a product you sell to other entrepreneurs.

## What are you actually selling?

Your kit includes:

- A commercial Telegram bot
- A full course (he + en)
- Full source code
- A landing page
- An admin interface
- Documentation and explanations

This is not "just a coding course". It's a **startup kit**.

## Possible licensing models

1. Personal license:
   - The buyer uses the kit only for their own project.

2. Agency license:
   - The buyer can use the bot for their clients.

3. White-label license:
   - You allow them to rebrand everything as their own.

Pricing changes based on the license type.

## Pricing the kit itself

Possible ranges:

- Personal license: 200–400 USD
- Agency license: 400–800 USD
- White-label license: 800–1500 USD

The kit saves dozens of development hours. That's the value.

## How to present the kit to an entrepreneur

Example:

> "Instead of building a bot and course from scratch, I give you a ready-made kit:
> - Working bot
> - Course that explains every line of code
> - Landing page
> - Full documentation
> You can build your own service on top of it."

## Basic contract principles

Not legal advice, but key points:

- What they are allowed to do with the kit
- What they are not allowed to do (e.g. resell the course as-is)
- Liability (no guarantee of income)
- Support (how long, via which channel)

You can add a sample contract file to the course.

## Building a sales funnel for the kit

One option:

1. Landing page explaining the kit
2. Bot that demonstrates the kit
3. Short Zoom call to close the deal
4. Send access to the course + code + ZIP

The kit you're building here is the foundation for all of this.

## Assignment

- Decide which license type you want to sell (personal / agency / white-label).
- Set a price range.
- Write a one-page explanation of the kit for an entrepreneur.
- Send it to one entrepreneur you know.

This kit can be your first real digital product as a founder.
