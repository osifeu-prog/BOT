# 📣 Marketing the bot to clients

Welcome to the marketing lesson. Here you'll learn how to turn your bot into something people actually want to pay for.

## Why does a client need a bot?

Before selling, understand the value:

- Saves time on answering repetitive questions
- Collects leads 24/7
- Sells courses/products automatically
- Provides a modern Telegram experience

You are not selling a "bot". You are selling a **business outcome**.

## Defining your target audience

Ask yourself:

- Who benefits the most from this?
- Course creators?
- Coaches?
- Consultants?
- Online shop owners?

Pick 1–2 audiences to start with. Don't try to sell to everyone.

## Crafting an offer

Example offer:

> "I'll build you a Telegram bot that sells your course 24/7, including:
> - Landing page
> - Bot that explains your course
> - Payment flow
> - Basic stats
> - A course that teaches you how to maintain it"

The kit you're building here is exactly the foundation for such an offer.

## Pricing for end clients

How much can you charge?

- One-time setup: 500–1500 USD
- Monthly maintenance: 50–200 USD
- Extra features: hourly or package-based

This course gives you a ready-made product, so your time is spent on customization, not building from scratch.

## Where to find clients?

- Facebook groups for business owners
- Entrepreneur communities
- LinkedIn
- Your existing mailing list
- Past clients

Most important tip: show them a **live demo** of your bot. Not a slide deck.

## Sample outreach script

1. "Hey, I saw you're selling an online course/service."
2. "Do you have a Telegram bot that sells it automatically?"
3. "I work with a ready-made bot kit that connects to your course and can increase conversions."
4. "If you want, I can show you a quick demo on Telegram."

The bot you're building here *is* that demo.

## Assignment

- Pick one target audience.
- Write one clear offer.
- Send it to 3 relevant people.
- Track their responses.

The first time feels awkward. By the third time, it feels natural.
